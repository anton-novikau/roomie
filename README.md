Roomie
===================


This project is not a real [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) Library, but just a demonstration of
how to use Android Annotation Processors to build something similar to [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/index.html)
and avoid boilerplate code working with [SQLiteOpenHelper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html),
[Cursor](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/Cursor.html) and [ContentValues](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentValues.html).

This demo project was prepared for Java Annotation Processors talk on GDG Minsk Meetup.
